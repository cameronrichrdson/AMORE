**Summary**

About FIXME:xx individuals were present. In these notes, DEK is Dan Kelley and CGR is
Clark Richards, while "group" indicates group discussion^[Please note that
individuals in the AMORE group will not be named in meeting notes without
permission.].

The main topic was regression, or curve-fitting, and the subtopics were as follows.

1. Regression as an optimization procedure: least-squares vs other cost
   functions, restriction of typically taught least-squares linear regression,
   difficulty of multiple minima, ill-constrained estimation, etc.
2. Linear regression of least-squares type: `lm()` and associated functions
   `summary()`, `plot()`, `coef()`, `predict()` and `confint()`.
3. Nonlinear regression: difficulties and how to avoid them, a shiny-enabled
   notebook for exploration.

**Plans**

In the next (4th) meeting, DEK will discuss FIXME.  After that, the 5th meeting
will involve FIXME.  The 5-week plan having been carried out, AMORE may still
continue through June and July if there is interest in active meetings involving
presentations by other group members, or question/answer meetings.

**Resources**

After the meeting, DEK made a little video, illustrating FIXME, available at FIXME.
