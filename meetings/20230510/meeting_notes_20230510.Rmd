**Summary**

About 15 individuals were present. In these notes, DEK is Dan Kelley and CGR is
Clark Richards, while "group" indicates group discussion^[Please note that
individuals in the AMORE group will not be named in meeting notes without
permission.].

Most of the time was spent with DEK talking about working with github.com and,
more generally, with git.  In this he was helped greatly by CGR.

A second topic was to show code in sandbox/dek/emag2, which deals with earth
magnetic anomaly data.  DEK showed the R files one by one (noting that their
names sort to give the order of working).  It is not possible for others to
follow the steps because DEK did not include in the repo the large `.rda` file
that is required for this work.  That file could be put on Dropbox if anyone
wants ... just email DEK.

**Plans**

In the next meeting, DEK will discuss regression, both linear and nonlinear.
The focus will be not just on the R functions that do these things, but also on
the theory behind them.  That theory is essential to do quite a lot of nonlinear
curve fitting, in particular.

**Resources**

After the meeting, DEK made a little video, which will be put in Dropbox, at
