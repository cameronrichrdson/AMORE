# Choice of network solver

The `nnet()` function provides a good introduction to neural network analysis in
R, mainly because it is so easy to use.  But be aware that it has just a single
"hidden layer", which means that it cannot handle complicated tasks as well as
"convolutional" networks can, with their multiple hidden layers.  Another
limitation is that it uses `optim()` to do the optimization, which is likely to
be slower, and perhaps less effective, than more modern approaches.

Essentially, `nnet()` is a product of the early years of neural networks, before
Hinton and colleagues showed how back-propagation enables fast solution of
complex multilayered networks.

The paper by @rumelhart_learning_1986 was the start of the new age of neural
networks, and it should be readable by anyone who is comfortable with Calculus
and has a bit of patience for notation. As for software, the recent book by
@chollet_deep_2022 introduces R users to the popular "Keras/TensorFlow" system.
(A caveat: this system derives from a Python system and so it does not follow a
functional path, i.e. Keras functions usually modify their input.)

# Simulation

The app given below illustrate a test of using a neural network to represent the
equation of state of seawater, $\sigma=\rho(S_A, C_T)-1000$kg/m$^3$.  This is
not something worth doing in a practical sense, since we already know the
equation of state, but it makes for a clear illustration of some concepts
relating to network size and training-set size. Try adjusting the sliders for
these things, to gain some intuition on how the accuracy of the solution varies
with network size and training-set size.  The red dots are the training set,
which is regenerated randomly whenever either slider is altered, or when the
"New samples" button is clicked.  The "Reset sliders" button returns the sliders
(but not the random numbers) to the initial state.
